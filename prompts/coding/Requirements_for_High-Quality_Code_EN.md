# Requirements for High-Quality Programs

## 1. Readability
- Code should be understandable and clear
- Use descriptive and meaningful names for variables and functions
- Code formatting should be consistent and readable
- Use comments and documentation appropriately to clarify code intent

## 2. Efficiency
- Optimize code to improve performance
- Avoid redundant or unnecessary operations
- Select appropriate algorithms and data structures for efficient implementation
- Minimize memory usage and CPU usage

## 3. Modularity
- Divide code into logical functions and classes
- Practice proper separation of concerns, ensuring each module has a single responsibility
- Keep coupling between modules low, aiming for loose coupling
- Clearly define interfaces to simplify interactions between modules

## 4. Extensibility
- Design flexibly to facilitate future changes and addition of new features
- Apply the Open/Closed Principle (OCP) to enable extension without modifying existing code
- Utilize dependency injection (DI) to manage dependencies between modules
- Use appropriate design patterns to improve extensibility and maintainability

## 5. Best Practices and Design Patterns
- Follow established best practices for the specific programming language
- Apply the DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) principle to avoid code duplication
- Respect SOLID principles (Single Responsibility, Open/Closed, Liskov Substitution, Interface Segregation, Dependency Inversion)
- Use appropriate design patterns (singleton, factory, observer, etc.) to improve code structure and reusability

## 6. Testing
- Properly conduct unit tests, integration tests, and system tests to ensure code quality
- Adopt test-driven development (TDD), developing tests and code simultaneously
- Utilize mocks and stubs to enhance test independence
- Increase test coverage to ensure all parts of the code are adequately tested

## 7. Security
- Follow secure coding practices to avoid common vulnerabilities
- Properly validate and sanitize user input
- Encrypt and securely store sensitive information
- Apply the principle of least privilege, ensuring each component has only the minimum necessary permissions
