# Repository Quality Verification Prompt V3

You are an expert in code review and repository structure analysis. Please perform a quality verification of the entire repository according to the following checklist. Evaluate each item as "✅" (no issues), "❌" (issues found), or "⚠️" (partial issues), and if there are problems, provide specific improvement suggestions.

## Checklist

### 📝 README.md Quality Verification

- [ ] Are tech stack badges appropriately placed and center-aligned
- [ ] Are language switch badges (Japanese/English) center-aligned
- [ ] Are emojis used in each section to improve readability
- [ ] Are installation instructions concise and clearly described
- [ ] Are usage instructions concise and clearly described
- [ ] Are screenshots or diagrams used as appropriate

### 📚 Overall Documentation Consistency
- [ ] Do README.md (English) and README_JP.md (Japanese) exist at each level (create if missing)

- [ ] Do READMEs at each level appropriately reference higher-level READMEs, avoiding duplication
- [ ] Are README contents simplified to reference code as much as possible
- [ ] Are redundant sections or expressions avoided
- [ ] Is consistent terminology used across all documents

### 🔒 Environment Configuration and Security

(similar format for other sections)

### 🔍 Overall Assessment
Provide a concise assessment of the repository's current state and present the 3 most important improvements that should be prioritized.

### 📝 Specific Correction Examples
For the most important improvement points, provide specific code or markdown correction examples.

#### README.md Hierarchical Structure Verification
Please verify with special attention to the following points:
1. Check if each directory has README.md (English) and README_JP.md (Japanese), and suggest creation if missing
2. Verify that each README includes language switch badges and has center-aligned titles
3. Confirm that README contents are simplified and contain no redundant information
4. Verify that each README appropriately references higher-level READMEs to avoid duplication

#### Standard Format for Language Switch Badges
Place language switch badges like the following, center-aligned, in each README:

```markdown
<p align="center">
    <a href="README_JP.md"><img src="https://img.shields.io/badge/ドキュメント-日本語-white.svg" alt="JA doc"/></a>
	<a href="README.md"><img src="https://img.shields.io/badge/english-document-white.svg" alt="EN doc"></a>
</p>
```
