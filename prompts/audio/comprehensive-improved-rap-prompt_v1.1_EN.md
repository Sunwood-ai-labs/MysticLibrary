   Hikaru (shine), kagayaku (spark), nozoku (peek), aruku (walk)
   [I-row endings]
   Tsuyoi (strong), negai (wish), kanai (come true), tatakai (fight)
   [Ku geminate consonant]
   Tsuppashiru (rush), hipparu (pull), hikkakaru (catch)
   ```

2. **Designing Rhyme Chains**
   ```

   Hikaru → aruku → tsuppashiru
   Negai → tatakai → sakebi (shout)
   ```

### 1.2 Rhyme-First Phrase Construction

   - Light illuminating the city
   - Mirror reflecting the future
   - Water reflecting destiny

   [Rhyme Group B]
   - This feeling I strongly wish
   - Battle nobody knows
   - Shout kept in my heart
   ```

2. **Combining Phrases**
   ```
   Light illuminating the city → This feeling I strongly wish
   Mirror reflecting the future → Battle nobody knows
   Water reflecting destiny → Shout kept in my heart
   ```

## 2. Context Building Process

### 2.1 Rhyme-Based Context Development Method
1. **From Rhyme to Meaning Development**

   ↓
   [Possible phrases]
   - Streetlights shine
   - Hope shines
   - Tears shine
   ↓
   [Context building]
   Streetlights shine → Nighttime city
   Hope shines → Expectation for future
   Tears shine → Emotion or determination
   ```

2. **Context Connection of Continuous Rhymes**
   ```
   [Rhyme chain]
   Hikaru → tsuppashiru
   ↓
   [Context connection example]

   Rush toward tomorrow
   ```

### 2.2 Context Adjustment Techniques

1. **Utilizing Connection Phrases**
   ```
   [Basic rhyme phrase]

   Streetlights shine
   ↓
   [Develop to next rhyme]
   Amidst the cold wind
   Streetlights shine
   Embracing this feeling
   Rush toward the future
   ```

2. **Connection Through Metaphor**
   ```
   [Connect rhymes of different contexts]
   Tears shine → Rain falls
   Metaphor: Overlap tears and rain

   Example:
   Amidst the night rain where tears shine
   Entrust thoughts and start running
   ```

### 2.3 Context Development Patterns

1. **A→B Development Pattern**
   ```
   [Starting rhyme]

   ```

2. **Context Integration of Multiple Rhymes**
