# Low-Poly Animal Grid Generator プロンプト V1

```bash
Create a **low-poly** illustration of nine different [ANIMAL] icons arranged in a crisp **3 × 3 grid** (three rows, three columns).  
Each animal occupies its own equal-sized square cell with consistent spacing so the nine cells together form a perfect square.

For every icon  
• Model the animal as a **clean triangular-facet low-poly mesh**—think tiny digital sculptures rather than flat cartoons.  
• Shade each facet with **solid, flat colors only** (no gradients, smudging, airbrushing, or blur).  
• Let the facet planes and subtle **ambient occlusion** provide depth; avoid traditional soft shadows.  
• Outline the silhouette and major feature breaks with **thick, bold black strokes** to keep a graphic edge.  
• Stick to a **simplified retro palette** (teal, coral, mustard, navy, ivory, and white) for a vintage feel.  
• Include a few small **sparkle accents or motion lines** on or around each animal for extra charm, but keep the animal itself the clear focus.

Global requirements  
• Place the entire 3 × 3 grid on a **plain white background**.  
• Keep all geometry crisp and **vector-friendly**—no textures or raster effects.  
• Final output must have a **perfectly square aspect ratio** (the nine cells together forming one square).  
• Ensure all edges remain sharp so the artwork scales cleanly at any resolution.
