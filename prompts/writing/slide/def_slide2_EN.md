# What I Want to Do

## References
- `design` = [https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Sunwood-ai-labs/MysticLibrary/develop/prompts/writing/slide/def_slide_design2.md]
- `text` = [https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Sunwood-ai-labs/MysticLibrary/develop/prompts/writing/slide/def_slide_text1.md]

## TODO

1. Refer to the `design` file content and add appropriate background images to all pages.
2. Convert the `text` file content to reveal.js format markdown, excluding code blocks.
3. Accurately reflect the positions of -- as specified in the `design` file.
4. Separate each slide with -- and organize for readability.
5. Always set text color to white and optimize contrast with the background color.
6. Apply additional styling to each slide as needed to maintain overall consistency and aesthetics.
