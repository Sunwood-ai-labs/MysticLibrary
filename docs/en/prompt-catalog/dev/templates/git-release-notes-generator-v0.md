# Git Release Notes Creation Prompt V0

A prompt to create detailed release notes from commit history and code differences between specified tags.

## Intended Use

- Create release notes for Git repositories
- Analyze differences between tags and summarize changes
- Extract issue numbers to track related changes

## Prompt Text

```text
# Git Release Notes Creation Prompt V0

Follow the steps below to create release notes from the commit history and code differences between specified tags in a GitHub repository.

Use tags v1.23.0 and v1.22.0 to create release notes for v1.23.0.

## Required Commands

```bash
# Get commits between specified tags
git log [previous-tag]..[current-tag] --pretty=format:"%h %s"

# Get code differences between specified tags
git diff [previous-tag] [current-tag] --name-status
git diff [previous-tag] [current-tag]

# Get statistics
Commit count: git log [previous-tag]..[current-tag] --oneline | wc -l
Contributor count: git log [previous-tag]..[current-tag] --format="%an" | sort -u | wc -l
Changed files count: git diff --name-only [previous-tag] [current-tag] | wc -l
```

## Processing Steps

1. Extract issue numbers (#number format) from commit messages.

2. Analyze code differences (`full_diff.txt`) to grasp the details of changes:
   - Newly added functions and features
   - Details of fixed bugs
   - Specific changes in performance improvements
   - Details of configuration changes and version upgrades

3. Categorize commits:
   - ✨ New Features: Commits containing keywords like feat, add, 新機能, 追加
   - 🐛 Bug Fixes: Commits containing keywords like fix, 修正, バグ
   - ⚡ Performance Improvements: Commits containing keywords like perf, performance, 最適化
   - 📚 Documentation: Commits containing keywords like doc, ドキュメント
   - 🔧 Configuration Changes: Commits containing keywords like config, 設定, 環境
   - 🔄 Other Changes: Commits that don't fit into the above categories

4. For each change, add specific information obtained from code differences.
