# Git Release Notes Generator Prompt V1

Follow the steps below to create release notes from commit history and code diffs between specified tags in a GitHub repository.

Create release notes for v0.1.0
Compare with the previous tag

## Required Commands

```bash
# Get commits between specified tags
git log [previous_tag]..[current_tag] --pretty=format:"%h %s"

# Get code diffs between specified tags
git diff [previous_tag]..[current_tag] --name-status
git diff [previous_tag]..[current_tag]

# Get statistics
Commits: git log [previous_tag]..[current_tag] --oneline | wc -l
Contributors: git log [previous_tag]..[current_tag] --format="%an" | sort -u | wc -l
Changed files: git diff --name-only [previous_tag]..[current_tag] | wc -l
```

## Processing Steps

1. Extract Issue numbers (#number format) from commit messages.

2. Analyze code diffs to better understand changes:
   - Newly added functions and features
   - Details of bug fixes
   - Specific performance improvement changes
   - Config changes and version upgrades

3. Categorize commits:
   - ✨ New Features: commits with feat, add, new features, addition keywords
   - 🐛 Bug Fixes: commits with fix, fix, bug keywords
   - ⚡ Performance: commits with perf, performance, optimization keywords
   - 📚 Documentation: commits with doc, documentation keywords
   - 🔧 Config Changes: commits with config, settings, environment keywords
   - 🔄 Other Changes: commits not in above categories

4. Add specific information from code diffs for each change.

5. Use gh command to create release notes
