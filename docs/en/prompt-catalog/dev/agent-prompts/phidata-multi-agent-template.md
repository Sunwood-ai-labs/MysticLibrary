from phi.storage.agent.sqlite import SqlAgentStorage

# Data Collection Agent
data_collector = Agent(
    name="data_collector",
    role="Data Collection Specialist",
    model=OpenAIChat(id="gpt-4"),
    tools=[
        DuckDuckGo(),
        YFinanceTools(enable_all=True)
    ],
    instructions=[
        "Collect real estate market data",
        "Prioritize reliable sources",
        "Perform data preprocessing and formatting"
