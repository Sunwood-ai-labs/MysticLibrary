# Requirements Document for LLM: Generate Prime Number × Image Prompts from Keywords

## 1. Introduction

This requirements document defines instructions for large language models (LLMs) to generate image generation prompts using prime number theory concepts based on user-provided keywords.

## 2. Objectives

- **Advanced Prompt Generation from Keywords**: Create image generation prompts using prime number theory based on user-provided keywords.
- **Application of Prime Number Theory**: Incorporate the aperiodicity and complexity of prime numbers into prompts to enhance uniqueness and creativity.
- **Integration of Custom Frameworks**: Reflect user's custom frameworks and additional elements to achieve one-of-a-kind expressions.

## 3. Requirements

### 3.1 Input Requirements

- **Accept Keywords**: Receive one or more keywords as input from the user.
- **Consider Custom Frameworks**: Understand and incorporate custom frameworks or concepts presented by the user.

### 3.2 Prompt Generation Requirements

1. **Application of Prime Number Theory**:
   - **Introduction of Aperiodicity**: Propose elements where randomness and regularity coexist.
   - **Fractal Structure**: Incorporate elements that create self-similarity and complex patterns.
   - **Color and Shape Rhythm**: Include color and shape variations based on prime numbers.
   - **Algorithmic Patterns**: Suggest geometric arrangements and mosaic effects using prime numbers.

2. **Specificity and Clarity**:
   - Use specific and clear expressions that image generation AIs can accurately interpret.

3. **Enhanced Creativity and Uniqueness**:
   - Avoid common expressions and clichés, using highly original expressions.

## Input Example

- Keywords: "Starry sky", "Future city"
- Custom Framework: "Transcending the concept of time", "Organic growth patterns"

## Output Example

"A starry sky where stars shine with the aperiodic rhythm of prime numbers; the silhouette of a future city is drawn with a fractal structure, showing organic growth patterns that transcend the concept of time."
```

## How to Use

1. Paste the prompt into an AI
2. Enter keywords and custom framework
3. Use the generated prompt in an image generation AI

## Notes

- Maintain ethical considerations
- Respect copyright
- Respect user's intent
