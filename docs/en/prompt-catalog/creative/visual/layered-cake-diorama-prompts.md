# Layered Cake Diorama Prompts

## Intended Use

- Generating artworks that fuse food and miniatures
- Creating high-end food photography style images
- Design inspiration for creative diorama scenes
- Reference for original visual storytelling

## Prompt

This prompt adapts to various diorama themes. Below are representative examples.

### Pattern 1: Sengoku-period Japanese Castle

```text
A hyper-realistic composite still-life image of a cross-sectioned layered cake transformed into a miniature Sengoku-period Japanese castle scene. The top layer supports a majestic tenshu (keep) with stone ramparts and tiered roofs, while the interior layers reveal a fully realized castle-town: winding streets of wooden machiya, tiny merchants' stalls, watchtowers, and sakura trees rooted in "soil" made of chocolate crumb. Each cake stratum displays rich textures—sponge, nuts, seeds, and earthy fillings—interwoven with roots and miniature waterways. Studio-lit photography, dramatic shadows, and crisp focus evoke high-end food photography combined with exquisite miniature realism.
```

### Pattern 2: Stone Watchtower

```text
A hyper-realistic composite still-life image of a cross-sectioned layered cake transformed into a miniature towering scene. Rising from the top layer is an imposing stone watchtower with moss-covered battlements and a tiny fluttering banner. Each interior cake stratum reveals successive floors of the tower: a spiral staircase carved into rich chocolate sponge, a torch-lit armory embedded in nut-filled praline, a candle-glow library tucked into vanilla chiffon, and a hidden alchemist's lab nestled within pistachio cream "bedrock." Roots, seeds, and crumbs form realistic soil textures between layers, while delicate sugar-glass windows and wafer-thin ramparts add crisp architectural detail. Studio-lit photography with dramatic shadows and razor-sharp focus evokes high-end food photography blended with exquisite miniature realism.

## How to Use

1. **Select theme**: Decide on the diorama theme you want to create, referencing the patterns above
2. **Customize prompt**: Adjust cake layers and elements according to the theme
3. **Input to image generation AI**: Enter into Midjourney, Stable Diffusion, DALL-E, etc.
4. **Review output**: Check the hyper-realistic diorama image

## Input Example

```text
Theme: Medieval village
Adjustment: Arrange small houses, wells, and markets in cake layers
```

## Output Example

The generated image will include the following characteristics:

- Cross-sectioned layered cake structure
- Detailed miniature scenes unfolding in each layer
- Rich textures (sponge, nuts, seeds, earthy fillings)
- Natural integration through roots and miniature waterways
- Dramatic shadows from studio lighting
- Fusion of high-end food photography and exquisite miniatures

## Notes

- Requires ultra-high definition image generation
- Emphasizes studio lighting and dramatic shadows
- Aims for clear focus and sharp edges
- Maintains food photography quality
- Prioritizes miniature realism
