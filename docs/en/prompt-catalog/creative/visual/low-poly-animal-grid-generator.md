# Low-Poly Animal Grid Generator

## Intended Use

- Creating icon sets for websites and applications
- Generating low-poly style illustrations
- Creating unified animal icon series
- Generating vector-quality clip art

## Prompt

```text
Create a **low-poly** illustration of nine different [ANIMAL] icons arranged in a crisp **3 × 3 grid** (three rows, three columns).
Each animal occupies its own equal-sized square cell with consistent spacing so the nine cells together form a perfect square.

For every icon
• Model the animal as a **clean triangular-facet low-poly mesh**—think tiny digital sculptures rather than flat cartoons.
• Shade each facet with **solid, flat colors only** (no gradients, smudging, airbrushing, or blur).
• Let the facet planes and subtle **ambient occlusion** provide depth; avoid traditional soft shadows.
• Outline the silhouette and major feature breaks with **thick, bold black strokes** to keep a graphic edge.
• Stick to a **simplified retro palette** (teal, coral, mustard, navy, ivory, and white) for a vintage feel.
• Include a few small **sparkle accents or motion lines** on or around each animal for extra charm, but keep the animal itself the clear focus.

Global requirements
• Place the entire 3 × 3 grid on a **plain white background**.
• Keep all geometry crisp and **vector-friendly**—no textures or raster effects.
• Final output must have a **perfectly square aspect ratio** (the nine cells together forming one square).
• Ensure all edges remain sharp so the artwork scales cleanly at any resolution.
```

## How to Use

1. **Specify animal type**: Enter the type of animal you want to generate in the `[ANIMAL]` placeholder
2. **Adjust color palette**: Customize the color palette as needed
3. **Input to image generation AI**: Enter into Midjourney, Stable Diffusion, DALL-E, etc.
4. **Review output**: Check the nine animal icons arranged in a 3×3 grid

## Input Example

```text
Create a **low-poly** illustration of nine different forest animal icons arranged in a crisp **3 × 3 grid**...
```

Or

```text
Create a **low-poly** illustration of nine different sea creature icons arranged in a crisp **3 × 3 grid**...
```

## Output Example

The generated illustration will include the following characteristics:

- Nine different animals arranged in a 3×3 grid
- Low-poly triangular facet modeling
- Shading with solid, flat colors
- Thick bold black stroke outlines
- Retro color palette (teal, coral, mustard, navy, ivory, white)
- White background, vector-friendly clean edges

## Notes

- No gradients or blur effects are used
- Avoids textures or raster effects
- Maintains a perfectly square aspect ratio
- Aims for vector-quality sharp edges
