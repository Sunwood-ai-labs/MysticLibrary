The gorgeous night begins

Neon glowing Tokyo night
Everyone dreams and dances
If tears turn to tomorrow
Tonight let's laugh with all our heart

[Verse 2]
Standing at Ginza street corner
Forgetting past and future completely
Heart rides the music
This is my way of life

Yoi-ya-sa-kora Sa-sa-sa and dance
Put wishes into the night sky
Enka soul burns bright
Hope for tomorrow rides the song

[Bridge]
Overcoming all difficulties
Moving forward together with friends
Don't cool that hot heart
We live strongly

[Chorus]
Yoi-ya-sa-kora Sa-sa-sa and dance
Put wishes into the night sky
Enka soul burns bright
Hope for tomorrow rides the song

[Outro]
Dawn breaks, a new morning
Let's sing again tomorrow

[End]
