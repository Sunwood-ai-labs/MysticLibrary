[Intro]
Don't know what limits are
Until this voice resounds
Keep chasing dreams
Carve out tomorrow

Walking the path illuminated by streetlights
Though lost, I keep facing forward
Stronger each time I hit a wall
Reborn as a new self

[Hook]
Go beyond the limits
To a future only for us
Hot feelings dwelling in the chest
Now I'll prove it

[Verse 2]
In solitude nobody knows
Believe in tomorrow and start walking
Turning tears into light
We won't stop

[Outro]
This dream never ends
A story only for us
```
