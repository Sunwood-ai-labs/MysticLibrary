# Graphic Recording (Graleco) HTML Creation Prompt V2 (Full Moon Dark Theme)

Please create a graphic recording in HTML following the requirements below.

## What is Graphic Recording
Graphic recording (graleco) is a method of summarizing the content of meetings and presentations in real time using diagrams, illustrations, and text. It makes it easier to grasp the overall picture of discussions and facilitates the generation of ideas. Compared to text-only minutes, it conveys information intuitively, and visual records are more likely to be retained in memory.

## Basic Requirements
- Use handwritten-style fonts (Kaisei Decol, Yomogi, Zen Kurenaido)
- Use Font Awesome icons and emojis largely instead of illustrations (size around 70px)
- Make card backgrounds transparent, avoid using borders, and blend them with the background
- Express handwritten-style speech bubbles with CSS (background should have light transparency)
- Responsive design
- 5-column layout (container width 2000px)
- Wide spacing between cards (around 40px)
- Grid gap: 30px

## Typography
- Title: 32px, gradient effect, bold, place Font Awesome icons on left and right
- Subtitle: 16px, #475569, include relevant Font Awesome icon
- Section heading: 18px, #1e40af, always place Font Awesome icon on left side with animation effect
- Body text: 14px, #334155, line height 1.4, include small relevant Font Awesome icons or emojis for important keywords
- Font specification: Kaisei Decol, Yomogi, Zen Kurenaido
