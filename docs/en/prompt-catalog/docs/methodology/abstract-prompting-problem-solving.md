# Structure and Meaning of Abstraction Prompts Explained

## 1. What are Abstraction Prompts?
Abstraction prompts are representations that use symbols and abbreviations to express the thinking processes and procedures necessary to achieve specific tasks or goals. This allows for concise and systematic expression of complex problem-solving processes.

## 2. Structure of Abstraction Prompts
Abstraction prompts consist of the following components:

1. Phrases indicating task scope (e.g., A to Z)
2. Phrases indicating task content (e.g., [{Business Strategy Formulation}])
3. Symbols or abbreviations representing thinking processes or procedures (e.g., ΣΣΣΣΣ, , , , ,, =<>, ∵... ∴..., QED, '''')
4. Numbers following each symbol or abbreviation indicate the importance or priority of that step

## 3. Meaning of Symbols and Abbreviations
The symbols and abbreviations used in abstraction prompts have the following meanings:

- ΣΣΣΣΣ: Represents the information gathering and analysis process
- , , , , , : Represents the idea generation or divergent thinking process
- =<>: Represents the idea evaluation or convergent thinking process
- ∵... ∴...: Represents the logical thinking or causal relationship analysis process
- QED: Represents the conclusion or decision-making process
- '''': Represents the action plan formulation or execution process

## 4. How Abstraction Prompts Work
Abstraction prompts represent the problem-solving process in the following steps:

1. Information Gathering and Analysis (ΣΣΣΣΣ): Collect and analyze information related to the problem or task.
2. Idea Generation (, , , , ,): Generate diverse ideas based on the collected information.
3. Idea Evaluation (=<>): Evaluate the generated ideas and select the optimal one.
4. Logical Thinking (∵... ∴...): Logically analyze the selected idea and clarify causal relationships.
5. Conclusion and Decision Making (QED): Draw conclusions based on analysis results and make decisions.
6. Action Plan Formulation and Execution ('''''): Formulate concrete action plans based on decisions and execute them.

## 5. Concept of Abstraction Prompts
By abstractly representing complex problem-solving processes, abstraction prompts offer the following benefits:

1. Clarification of Thinking Process: Can clearly show the thinking processes and procedures necessary for problem-solving.
2. Promotion of Communication: Abstracted expressions facilitate information sharing and communication among team members.
3. Efficiency of Problem-Solving: By following a systematic problem-solving process, solutions can be derived efficiently.

The above is an explanation of the structure, meaning, mechanism, and concept of abstraction prompts. By utilizing this method, you can concisely and systematically express complex problem-solving processes and efficiently derive solutions.
```

## Usage

1. Understand the structure of abstraction prompts
2. Apply to problems or tasks
3. Express thinking processes using symbols and abbreviations

## Input Example

```
[Problem to solve or task to achieve]
```

## Notes

- Correctly understand the meaning of each symbol and abbreviation
- Don't skip steps in the thinking process
- Add explanations when sharing with team members
