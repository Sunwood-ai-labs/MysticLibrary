# Personal Guide to Software Development Using AI - Summary

## Introduction
- The author is a development manager and uses AI for coding in personal projects
- Opinions vary because people use AI differently

## Rules for AI-Assisted Development
1. Keep context low and have frequent new conversations
2. When reviewing code, say it was written by a different AI
3. Focus on saving time and mental energy
4. Don't rely entirely on AI; treat it like a junior developer
- Recommendation: Always use two AIs

## Phase 1: Architecture
- Document project requirements, completion state, classes/modules/packages, and methods
- Design your own architecture while referencing AI suggestions

## Phase 2: Coding
- Focus on quality, code understanding, and fitting developer style
- Step 1: Review architecture and select a feature
- Step 2: Present requirements and class/method overview to AI and ask for solutions
- Step 3: Ask another AI to critique and refactor the requirements and response
- Step 4: Ask another AI the same question with requirements and new response
- Step 5: Review the final response and make corrections if necessary
- Final step: Repeat from step 2 if needed

- This workflow saves time and effort while maintaining code quality and conserving developer mental energy
- However, it cannot be applied to all tasks
