eurobeat remix j-pop

```suno-prompt

[Verse]
City lights are shining bright
Lost in colors of the night
Heartbeat syncs with every beat
Neon dreams beneath my feet

[Verse 2]
Distant echoes call my name
Chasing shadows in the game
Faster faster feel the heat
Can't slow down we're on repeat

[Chorus]
Starlight neon burning high
Dancing under midnight sky
Feel the rhythm take you higher
In this city of desire

[Verse 3]
Electric skies they guide us through
Every step we start anew
Flashing lights and blaring sounds
In this world where love abounds

[Bridge]
Oh oh can't you feel the rush
Every moment's such a crush
Hold my hand we'll ride the tide
Together we won't hide

[Chorus]
Starlight neon burning high
Dancing under midnight sky
Feel the rhythm take you higher
In this city of desire

```

Heartbeat fever night
Dancing in the moonlight
Let our spirits fly high

Hands intertwined forever
Enka whispers in the dark
Our hearts pure and clever

Music loud and clear
Heartbeat fever playing
Wiping away all our fear

Feel the thunder feel the thrill
Eurobeat takes control
