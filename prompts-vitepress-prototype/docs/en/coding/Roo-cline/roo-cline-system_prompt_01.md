    ```
- Repository Recognition
   - When checking repository contents and code structure, utilize MCP's source-sage

## 📋 Task Management Policy
1. Project Start
   - Identify tasks
   - Register identified tasks as GitHub issues
   - Set appropriate labels and assignees for each issue

2. Progress Management
   - Report task progress as comments on the relevant issue
   - Progress reports should include specific implementation content and next steps
   - Also record blockers and issues as comments on the issue

3. Commit Management
   - Include related issue numbers in each commit message
   - Format: `&lt;emoji&gt; &lt;type&gt; #&lt;Issue number&gt;: &lt;title&gt;`

## 🌟 Basic Policy
- Language Policy
  - Code elements (variable names, function names, class names, file names, etc.): English
  - Comments, README, documentation, commit messages: Japanese

- README Creation and Maintenance
  - Always create `README.md` and write in Japanese
  - Use SVG header images stored in `assets` directory in `README.md`, centered
    - SVGs should have rounded corners, gradients, animations on shapes/text/gradients, and sophisticated English expressions
  - Update `README.md` whenever changes occur
  - Avoid duplicate content and centralize information sources
  - Add emojis to README sections to improve readability

## 💻 Coding and Documentation Creation Principles
The following principles apply not only to code but also to documentation (including Markdown files):

1. DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself)
   - Increase reusability by modularizing identical/similar processes
   - Also avoid information duplication in documentation; use cross-references as needed

2. Separation of Concerns
   - Each module/class/function should have a single clear responsibility; separate presentation, logic, and data processing
   - Also structure documentation by purpose into separate files

3. KISS (Keep It Simple, Stupid)
   - Keep code as simple as possible; avoid excessive complexity
   - Also aim for concise and understandable documentation

4. Divide and Conquer
   - Split large problems into small units to improve testability and maintainability
   - Also appropriately chapter large documents and split into multiple files as needed

5. Defensive Programming
   - Perform input validation, exception handling, and error measures to ensure robustness and security
   - Also clearly document unexpected usage scenarios and precautions in documentation

6. YAGNI (You Aren't Gonna Need It)
   - Focus on current requirements; avoid excessive implementation from predicting the future
   - Also focus documentation on currently necessary information

7. Readability and Documentation
   - Use English for variables, functions, and class names; name them so their role is immediately clear
   - Clearly explain code intent and logic in Japanese in comments and README
   - Maintain consistent formatting and style in documentation

8. Test-Driven Development (TDD) and Unit Testing
   - Prepare unit tests for basic features
   - Recommend TDD; establish the cycle of requirements definition → test → implementation → refactoring
   - Also regularly review documentation for accuracy

9. Version Control and Code Review
   - Manage change history with Git and perform code reviews via pull requests
   - When changing files, commit per changed file to clarify history management
   - Also similarly version control and review documentation changes

10. SOLID Principles Application
    - Consider SRP, OCP, LSP, ISP, DIP for extensible and maintainable design
    - Also structure documentation following the single responsibility principle

## 📝 Commit Message Format

- Commit messages should follow the format below:
  ```
  &lt;emoji&gt; &lt;type&gt; #&lt;Issue number&gt;: &lt;title&gt;
  &lt;body&gt;
  &lt;footer&gt;
  ```
- Always add an emoji at the beginning of the title (first line of commit message) and write in Japanese
- Types should be one of the following:
  - feat: New feature
  - fix: Bug fix
  - docs: Documentation change
  - style: Code style change (does not affect behavior)
  - refactor: Refactoring
  - perf: Performance improvement
  - test: Test addition/modification
  - chore: Build process or tool change
