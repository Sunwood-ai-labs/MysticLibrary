### 2. Graphic Recording Elements
- Arrange information sequentially from upper left to right, from top to bottom
- Use Japanese handwritten style fonts (Yomogi, Zen Kurenaido, Kaisei Decol)
- Hand-drawn style enclosing lines, arrows, banners, speech bubbles
- Combination of text and visual elements (Font Awesome icons, simple shapes)
- Display Font Awesome icons representing each section's content largely (2x to 3x)
- Place related Font Awesome icons adjacent to each keyword
- Emphasize keywords (colored underlines, marker effects, decoration with Font Awesome)
- Connect related concepts with lines and arrows, inserting Font Awesome icons at connection points (fa-arrow-right, fa-connection, etc.)
- Appropriately utilize Font Awesome animation effects (fa-beat, fa-bounce, fa-fade, fa-flip, fa-shake, fa-spin)
- Place icons like "fa-circle-exclamation" and "fa-lightbulb" in prominent sizes for important points
- Attach related icons like "fa-chart-line" and "fa-percent" to numerical values and data
- Use expression icons (fa-face-smile, fa-face-frown, etc.) to express emotions and states
- Add hover effects to icons (color change, size change)
- Place faint Font Awesome patterns in background (place fa-shapes, etc. with reduced opacity)

### 3. Animation Effects
- Animations linked to Font Awesome icons (fa-beat, fa-bounce, fa-fade, etc.)
- Highlight effect when important keywords appear (gradient changes)
- Smooth flowing animations for connection lines and arrows
- Icon rotation and scale animations (especially where attention is desired)
- Gentle background gradient changes
- Element appearance effects linked to scrolling
- Click/tap responsive icon effects

### 4. Typography

  - Subtitle: 16px, #475569, add related Font Awesome icon
  - Section headings: 18px, #1e40af, always place Font Awesome icon on left side, icon has animation effect
  - Body text: 14px, #334155, line height 1.4, add small related Font Awesome icons for important keywords

    @import url('https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/font-awesome/6.4.0/css/all.min.css');
    &lt;/style&gt;
    ```

## Graphic Recording Expression Techniques
- Emphasize balance between text and visual elements (visually complement over 50% of text information with Font Awesome icons)

- Express numerical data with concise graphs and charts, place Font Awesome icons according to data type (fa-chart-pie, fa-chart-column, etc.)
- Explicitly show relationships between information with connection lines and arrows, attach icons according to relationship type (fa-link, fa-code-branch, etc.)
